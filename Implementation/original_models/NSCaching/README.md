## Instructions
For the sake of ease, a quick instruction is given for readers to reproduce the whole process on fb15k dataset.
Note that the programs are tested on Linux(Ubuntu release 16.04), Python 3.7 from Anaconda 4.5.11.

Install PyTorch (>0.4.0)
    
    conda install pytorch -c pytorch
    
Get this repo

    git clone https://github.com/yzhangee/NSCaching
    cd NSCaching
Get dataset from THUNLP-OpenKE
  
    git clone https://github.com/thunlp/OpenKE
    mv OpenKE/benchmarks ../KG_Data

### NSCaching+scratch on FB15K

    python train.py

### NSCaching (auto) on FB15K

    python auto_search.py   or    bash run_fb15k.sh
    
## New Opportunities
- Interns, research assistants, and researcher positions are available. See [requirement](http://www.cse.ust.hk/~qyaoaa/pages/job-ad.pdf)
