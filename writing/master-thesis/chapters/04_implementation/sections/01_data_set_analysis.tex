\section{Data Set Analysis}
\label{sec:data_set_analysis}


Initially, the approach will be implemented on the local computer and tested with small data sets such as \textsc{KINSHIP} or \textsc{UMLS}.
Subsequently, we want to compare our achieved accuracy with state-of-the-art approaches.
Therefore, we want to use \ac{MRR} and Hit@10 metrics on datasets \textsc{WN18}, \textsc{WN18RR}, \textsc{FB15K}, \textsc{FB15K237}, \textsc{YAGO3-10}.
