\section{Structure of the Thesis}
\label{sec:structure_of_thesis}


Our Thesis is structured as follows:
At first in \autoref{ch:introduction} a general introduction to the topic including the background is given, the 
the underlying problem was described and the objectives of this work were presented.
\autoref{ch:relatedwork} presents the \nameref{ch:relatedwork}, which introduces the various state of the art methods and technologies. 

\autoref{ch:background}

In \autoref{ch:approach} the general idea and a detailed description of our approach is given.
While the underlying theory is discussed in more detail here, in \autoref{ch:implementation} we describe the practical realization in the form of the implementation.
Subsequently, \autoref{ch:evaluation} evaluates our approach and compares it to existing methods using various datasets and metrics, and draws conclusions.
Lastly, \autoref{ch:summaryanddiscussion} summarizes our work and addresses any discussions for future work.
