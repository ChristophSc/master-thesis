\section{Objectives}

In this thesis, we aim to go one step further by generating more informative negative examples. 
By doing so, we aim to accelerate the learning process.
It is based on Uncertainty Sampling which aims to find more informative negative examples for embedding learning so that an improvement in the learning process and resulting embedding is achieved.
These can be hard negative examples, but also other negative triples which are valuable for the embedding model.
