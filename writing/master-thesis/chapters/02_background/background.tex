Active Learning and Uncertainty Sampling: \cite{5272205}
- Active Learning to minimize the amount of human labeling efforts required for a supervised classifier
- active learner has two major schemes: uncertainty sampling and committee-based sampling
- most uncertain per cluster: using density to weigh the selected examples
- or: select examples based on informativeness, diversity and density criteria
- outlier problem: uncertainty sampling often fails by selecting outliers
- motivation behind uncertainty sampling: find some unlabeled examples near decision boundaries and use them to clarify the position of decision boundaries -> most informative instances
- use density to determine whether an unlabeled example is highly representative
