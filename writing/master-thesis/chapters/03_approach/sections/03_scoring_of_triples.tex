\section{Scoring of Triples} 
\label{sec:scoring_of_triples}

3) Scoring of Triples
- What is uncertainty in relation to KGEs?
-> Uncertainty how to classify a triple -> negative or positive
- Where does the Uncertainty come from?
-> overlap of scores from positive and negative triple scoring ranges
Background: 
- presentation + reference to different scoring functions
-> scoring functions are used for loss functions
- different loss Functions for different scoring functions
- learning process goal: decrease the loss
-> a.k.a. increase margin between positives and negatives
-> Show Figure which illustrates positive and negative triples + margin between them
- examples:
    - DistMult: Score of positive triples need to be higher than for negative triples
    - TransE: score of negative need to be higher than for positive triples
- show Figure with positives + negative score ranges -> uncertainty in overlapping scores
- mathematical explanation with definition of loss function and scoring function
-> give an example of positive + negative where model is certain
-> give an example of positive + negative where model in uncertain

-> uncertainty according to scores which are returned by models
- models include only implicit information about the structure etc
- add additional information about structure, clusters, ...
- ... feature functions

- Option 1: Uncertainty from Generator Model: negative score < positive score
- Option 2: Uncertainty from Discriminator Model: negative score > positive score
-> depending on the, also the feature functions need to reflect the same score for positives/negatives
