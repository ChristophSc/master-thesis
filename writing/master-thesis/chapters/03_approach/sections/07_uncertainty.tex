For Uncertainty Sampling, we have several measures and frameworks at our disposal which are stated in \autoref{sec:uncertaintysampling}.
Entropy-based Uncertainty Sampling represents the standard approach and is used in for binary classification problems.
Since we are dealing with negative and positive triples and their distinction, our first approach will start with a binary classification problem for which we define label 0 for negative triples and 1 for positive triples.
For this we use standard entropy-based Uncertainty Sampling, which works with the probability that a given triple is positive. 
Further possibilities arise for example by using other Uncertainty Sampling variants and methods like \ac{EBU}, \ac{CU} or \ac{EAU} which set a different focus in Sampling and represent more complex alternatives, as additional factors are included in the calculation.
By choosing entropy-based Uncertainty Sampling we sample the instance whose posterior probability of being positive is nearest to 0.5 \cite{Settles2009ActiveLL}.
In our case, since we have a binary classification between negative triples ($y=0$) and positive triples ($y=1$), $<$ 0.5 represents a negative and $\geq$ 0.5 a positive triple.
The result is that we query examples that are close to 0.5, or in other words: 
we query triples where the embedding model is most uncertain how to label it.
