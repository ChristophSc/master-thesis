\chapter{Approach}
\label{ch:approach}

In this chapter our approach of Sampling of Negative Triples for Knowledge Graph Embeddings by Uncertainty is described.
At first, in \autoref{sec:idea} the general idea of Sampling by Uncertainty is described and how this idea came about.
Subsequently, 
Since the implementation of Uncertainty Sampling is initially based on the \ac{KBGAN} approach, the architecture and the corresponding procedure of our approach is described in \autoref{sec:architectureandprocedure}.
From this procedure and the required information within the steps of the procedure and Uncertainty Sampling, the following sections result.
First, we introduce the various feature functions (\autoref{sec:featurefunctions}) that provide additional information about the graph and contribute for measuring the "uncertainty" of our model.
Subsequently, these feature functions are combined an weighted within our Generator Score which is described in more detail in \autoref{sec:generatorscore}.
From this Generator Score, which gives information about the plausibility of triples, the probabilities of triples whether they are positive or negative can be calculated (\autoref{sec:probabilities}). 
Finally, these probabilities are used to sample negative triples by the uncertainty of the model which is described in \autoref{sec:uncertaintysampling approach}.

%Option1: downward description/ big to small
%Uncertainty Sampling -> needs probabilities -> probability of being a positive/negative triple -> calculation of probabilities -> Generator Score -> features for Generator score

%Option 2: upward description -> small to big (current approach)
%(everything is understandable because it was described in section before
%features -> generator score -> probabilities -> uncertainty Sampling
