\chapter{Evaluation}
\label{ch:evaluation}

To validate all approaches of Uncertainty Sampling presented in \autoref{ch:approach}, this chapter evaluates them.
For this purpose, \autoref{ch:evaluation:sec:experimental_setup} first explains the experimental setup under which conditions and settings our evaluations were conducted.
Subsequently, the different Uncertainty Sampling methods Uncertainty Sampling Max and Uncertainty Sampling Distribution are first evaluated in \autoref{ch:evaluation:sec:evaluation_methods}.
Depending on which Uncertainty Metric the Uncertainty Sampling Distribution is based on, different probability distributions are calculated.
For this reason, an evaluation of these takes place in \autoref{ch:evaluation:sec:evaluation_metrics}.
A final evaluation of the best Sampling by Uncertainty approach is made in \autoref{ch:evaluation:sec:evaluation_uncertainty} to compare it to the original sampling of the \kbgan approach.
