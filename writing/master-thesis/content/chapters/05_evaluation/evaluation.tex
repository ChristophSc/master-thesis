\chapter{Evaluation}
\label{ch:evaluation}

To validate all approaches of Uncertainty Sampling presented in \autoref{ch:approach}, this chapter evaluates them.
For this purpose, \autoref{ch:evaluation:sec:experimental_setup} first explains the experimental setup under which conditions and settings our evaluations were conducted.
Subsequently, the different Uncertainty Sampling methods \textsc{UncertaintySamplingMax} and \textsc{UncertaintySamplingSoftmax} are first evaluated in \autoref{ch:evaluation:sec:evaluation_methods}.
Depending on which uncertainty metric of \textsc{UncertaintySamplingSoftmax}, different probability distributions are calculated.
For this reason, an evaluation of these takes place in \autoref{ch:evaluation:sec:evaluation_metrics}.
A final evaluation of the best sampling by uncertainty approach is made in \autoref{ch:evaluation:sec:evaluation_uncertainty} to compare it to the original sampling of \kbgan.
