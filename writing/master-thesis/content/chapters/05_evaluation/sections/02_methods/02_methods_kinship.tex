\textbf{KINSHIP Dataset}

A sharp increase in evaluation metrics can also be seen on the \kinship dataset, especially at the beginning of the training (\Autoref{fig:advtrain_kinship_usmax_ussoftmax}).

\end{figure}
With both \usmax and \ussoftmax, the values increase steadily up to about 100 epochs.
In contrast to the \umls data set, however, the models with a \transd discriminator perform significantly better than those with a \transe discriminator.
So they do not seem to depend on the generator model as with the \umls dataset.
Furthermore, this difference between the different models in the discriminator can also be seen in the \ussoftmax sampling approach.
Equal to the \umls dataset, however, is that with \usmax there is a drop in the evaluation metrics after reaching the maximum at 100 epochs, but the values continue to increase slightly with \ussoftmax.
Furthermore, there is a significant increase in the Hit@10 metric with the model pairs with a \transd discriminator.
These reach a value of over 65\% with \ussoftmax, whereas they remained below this with \usmax and the other model pairs.

The learning behavior of the two sampling methods with the different model pairs can also be seen in the progression of the losses and rewards depicted in \Autoref{fig:advtrain_kinship_usmax_ussoftmax_losses_rewards}.

\end{figure}
Especially for the losses and rewards, there is a clear difference between the different model pairs.
While the losses initially decrease for all model pairs, they increase again with \usmax after 100 epochs for almost all model pairs.
Only with the model pair \complex and \distmult they continue to decrease.
The same applies to the rewards with \usmax.
With \ussoftmax, on the other hand, the clear distinction of the model pairs with \transd discriminator can be seen again. 
However, although the rewards decrease with \ussoftmax with \transd discriminator, the evaluation metrics for exactly these model pairs take a high value.
