\subsection{FB15k-237 Dataset}
\label{subsec:methods_fb15k237}

Since the two data sets WN18 and WN18RR are very similar in terms of data and represent a subset of the WordNet, an evaluation now also follows on a large data set in which the data differ from the WordNet.
Evaluation Metrics of \usmax and \ussoftmax trained on \textsc{FB15k-237} are depicted in \Autoref{fig:advtrain_fb15k237_usmax_ussoftmax}.

With \usmax and \ussoftmax MRR evaluation metric reach their maximum at 100 epochs. 
Thus, with \usmax MRR for most model pairs decrease, just for \complex + \transe it stays on the same level.
In comparison, with \ussoftmax all model pairs stay at the same MRR over all epochs.
Regarding Hit@10 evaluation metric all model pairs perform equally, only the model pair \complex + \transe the value increases over time.
The other model pairs decrease after a maximum Hit@10 of about 37\% after 100 epochs.
Additionally, it can be seen that \usmax increases Hit@10 over time for \complex + \transe but not for the other model pairs.
Its maximum is reached after 100 epochs with about 40\% Hit@10.
In comparison, with \ussoftmax this maximum is already reached after 100 epochs and it slightly increases Hit@10 as well as MRR over time.

If we compare training losses and rewards of \usmax and \usmax on \textsc{FB15k-237} we see a similar behaviour as on \textsc{WN18} and \textsc{WN18RR} (\Autoref{fig:advtrain_fb15k237_usmax_ussoftmax_losses_rewards}).

The losses of all model pairs in \usmax as well as \ussoftmax decrease over time.
Surprisingly just \complex + \transe increase again after 400 epochs, since this model pair also increases MRR and Hit@10 but not for the other model pairs over time.
Interestingly, in \usmax and \ussoftmax rewards for model pairs of with \transe in discriminator are higher than for the other model pairs.
