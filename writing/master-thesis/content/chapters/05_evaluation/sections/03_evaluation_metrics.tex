\section{Evaluation of the Uncertainty Metrics}
\label{ch:evaluation:sec:evaluation_metrics}

In the previous section, the two uncertainty sampling methods were only compared with the uncertainty metric entropy.
Since \ussoftmax was found to be a slightly better sampling method, this section now compares and evaluates the different uncertainty metrics entropy, least confidence, margin of confidence and ratio of confidence with \ussoftmax. 
These are also analysed for the four different data sets in \Autoref{subsec:metrics_umls} to \ref{subsec:metrics_fb15k237}.

\textbf{Conclusion}:\\

- no significant difference between uncertainty metrics
- in some cases MMR stagnates after about 300 epochs
- sometimes small difference between other discriminator models
-> best sampling by uncertainty with sampling method \ussoftmax and any uncertainty metrics -> we choose entropy
