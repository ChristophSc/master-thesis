\section{Evaluation of Uncertainty Sampling}
\label{ch:evaluation:sec:evaluation_uncertainty}

Finally, the best sampling by uncertainty sampling method \ussoftmax with entropy uncertainty metric is evaluated by comparing it to the original sampling method \origsampling of \kbgan.
The evaluation takes place on all four data sets in following \Autoref{subsec:uncertainty_umls} to \ref{subsec:uncertainty_fb15k237}.

\subsection{Conclusion of Uncertainty Sampling}
In some cases like training on \textsc{FB15k-237} adversarial training with \ussoftmax seem to work and on small datasets like \umls even better than \origsampling.
Additionally, it is noticeable that training looks very different for different datasets.
Nevertheless, in most cases adversarial training with \origsampling still performs better and reaches higher MRR and Hit@10 values.
Therefore, measuring and sampling by uncertainty of generator to classify triples as positives and negatives does not necessarily imply uncertainty of the discriminator model.
Even if the generator model might be uncertain if a given triple is positive or negative, discriminator can be more certain about this classification.
Another reason might be that classification is not accurate enough.
During training we have observed that even if negative triples scoring ranges are lower than positive triple scoring ranges, this sometimes changes over training time.
Therefore, the overlap of both ranges increases.
In addition, uncertainty is currently only measured based on generators uncertainty score and does not include any further information about the \ac{KG}, its relations and entities.
