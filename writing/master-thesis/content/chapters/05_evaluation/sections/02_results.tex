\section{Results}

Until now, only the Entropy metric has been used to calculate the Uncertainty Score.
The sampling was done using a calculated probability distribution based on uncertainty scores (hereafter referred to as \textbf{Uncertainty Sampling Max Distribution}) as well as sampling of the triple with maximum uncertainty score (hereafter referred to as \textbf{Uncertainty Sampling Max}).
