\section{Algorithm}

The original algorithm of \kbgan was modified for \usgan by replacing the original sampling by sampling with uncertainty.
\Autoref{alg:ucgan} shows the individual steps of \kbgan in pseudo-code.
In it, replaced steps of \kbgan are marked in red and the new steps are marked in green.
The steps marked in black have not changed from the original approach.

It can be seen that the original sampling steps have been replaced and that sampling is no longer based on generator scores but uncertainty scores.
For the calculation of this uncertainty, further steps such as the calculation of $score_{min}$ and $score_{max}$ are necessary before the actual sampling to classify and then sample them.
