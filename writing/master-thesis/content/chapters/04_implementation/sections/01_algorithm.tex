\section{Algorithm}
\label{sec:algorithm}
% 1) create set of negative triples
% 2) score_min and score_max for positive and negative triples
% 3) classify triples
% 4) calculate uncertainty scores
% 5) calculate sampling probability based on uncertainty scores
The original algorithm of \kbgan was modified for \usgan by replacing the original sampling by sampling with uncertainty.
\Autoref{alg:ucgan} shows the individual steps of \usgan in pseudo-code.
In contrast to the original \kbgan approach, the sampling of a negative triple is based on the achieved uncertainty scores instead of generator scores.
In addition, the algorithm was supplemented by the necessary calculations.
Following the creation of the negative triple set neg, the minimum and maximum scoring values $score_{min}$ and $score_{max}$ were calculated.
Subsequently, a classification of negative triples is performed for the individual triples of the batch.
Based on the probability of belonging to the positive triple class, the uncertainty scores and the sampling probabilities can be calculated.
All other steps are the same as in the original \kbgan approach.
