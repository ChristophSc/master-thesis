\section{Hyperparameter Optimization}
\label{sec:hyperparameter_optimization}
%
As in \cite{TuckER}, all hyperparameters were chosen by random search based on validation set performance.
Since the processing time on the \umls dataset is low and can also be performed on the local computer, it was initially mainly worked with.
Accordingly, the adaptation of the model and the hyperparameter tuning was based on the results on the \umls data set.
This was subsequently applied to the other datasets.
This resulted in the hyperparameters for the different models shown in \Autoref{tab:hyperparams}.

The contraints and regularizations shown in the table are taken from the original paper \cite{cai2017kbgan}.
The hyperparameters include the dimension of the embeddings $k$, the learning rate $\lambda$, the metric for the distance-based embedding models, and their margin $\gamma$.
With these hyperparameters settings, an evaluation of our sampling method \usgan was carried out which is described in more detail in the next \Autoref{ch:evaluation}.
