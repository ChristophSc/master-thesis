\section{Hyperparameter Optimization}
\label{sec:hyperparameter_optimization}

As in \cite{TuckER}, all hyper-parameters were chosen by random search based in validation set performance.
This resulted in the hyper-parameters for the different models shown in \Autoref{tab:hyperparams}.
\input{content/chapters/04_implementation/hyperparameters_table}
With these hyper-parameters settings, an evaluation of our sampling method \ucgan was carried out.
