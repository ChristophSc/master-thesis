\section{Used Knowledge Graph Embeddings}

Additionally, we will test the impact of our Negative Sampling approach on different embeddings with the given datasets and compare in which areas our method outperforms the current state-of-the-art approaches.
For this reason, we will use the most common embeddings from the three groups of embedding types:
\textsc{TransE}, \textsc{TransH} for \textit{Translation-Based Models}, \textsc{DistMult} and \textsc{ComplEx} for \textit{Tensor Factorization-Based Models}, and \textsc{ConvE} and \textsc{ConEx} for \textit{Neural Network-Based Models}.
