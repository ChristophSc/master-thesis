\section{Processing on $PC^2$}
\label{sec:processing_on_pc2}
%
Since most of the evaluated datasets are large and running algorithms on them are computationally expensive, the servers of \ac{PC2} \footnote{https://pc2.uni-paderborn.de/} were used to ensure faster processing of the learning process.
The \ac{OCuLUS} cluster was used for this because of its GPU support.
For this, a \ac{VPN} connection was created with the server and the corresponding files were uploaded to the user directory.
Subsequently, a setup of the configuration files for job manager CCS has been executed to start jobs with a \texttt{ccsalloc} command.
