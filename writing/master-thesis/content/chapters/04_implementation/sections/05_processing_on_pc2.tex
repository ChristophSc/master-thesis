\section{Processing on $PC^2$}
\label{sec:processing_on_pc2}


Since these datasets are large and running algorithms on them are computationally expensive, we use the servers of \ac{PC2} \footnote{https://pc2.uni-paderborn.de/} to ensure faster processing of the learning process of our model.
The OCuLUS cluster was used for this because of its GPU support.
For this, a VPN connection was created with the server and the corresponding files were uploaded in the user directory.
Subsequently, a setup of the configuration files for job manager CCS was executed to start jobs with a \texttt{ccsalloc} command.
The syntax for executing a job looked like this:
\\
\texttt{ccsalloc -I -s now --duration 2h }\\ \texttt{--res=rset=1:ncpus=8:mem=20g:gpus=1:rtx2080=t python gan\_train.py}
\\
