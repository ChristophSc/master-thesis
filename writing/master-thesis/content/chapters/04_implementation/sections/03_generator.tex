\section{Generator}
\label{sec:generator}





The adversarial training runs via the \texttt{BaseModel} class depicted in \Autoref{fig:basemodel_classdiagram}.
This implements the methods \texttt{gen\_step} and \texttt{dis\_step}, which represent an iteration step of the generator and the discriminator respectively.
