\chapter{Implementation}
\label{ch:implementation}


After explaining our approach, we will now go into more detail about the implementation of \ucgan.
For this purpose, \autoref{sec:algorithm} first presents the \ac{GAN} training process in pseudo code.
Then, in the following \autoref{sec:creation_of_a_negative_triple_set} to \ref{sec:discriminator}, the individual components and classes that provide the functionalities for the training are presented.
At the end of this chapter hyperparameter optimization is described in \autoref{sec:hyperparameter_optimization} and configurations to run training on $PC^2$ is reported in \autoref{sec:processing_on_pc2}.
