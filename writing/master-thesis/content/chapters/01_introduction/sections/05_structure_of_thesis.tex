\section{Structure of the Thesis}
\label{sec:structure_of_thesis}

This thesis is structured as follows:
At first in \textbf{\Autoref{ch:introduction}} a general introduction to the topic is given, the problem is analysed, related work was mentioned and the objectives of this thesis were presented.
\textbf{\Autoref{ch:background}} establishes important definitions of terms and presents the state of the art of approaches and methods that are already existing in research.
In \textbf{\Autoref{ch:approach}} the general idea and a detailed description of our approach is given.
While the underlying theory is discussed in more detail here, in \textbf{\Autoref{ch:implementation}} we describe the practical realization in the form of the implementation.
Subsequently, \textbf{\Autoref{ch:evaluation}} evaluates our approach and compares it to existing methods using various datasets and metrics, and draws conclusions.
Lastly, \textbf{\Autoref{ch:summaryanddiscussion}} summarizes our work and addresses any discussions for future work.
