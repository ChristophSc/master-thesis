% EMBEDDING MODELS
In recent years there has been much research on \acp{KGE} and negative sampling techniques.  
Dai et. al created an overview of several different and most commonly used embedding models, their approaches, and application possibilities \cite{electronics9050750}.
Among many different embedding models, distance-based models such as \transe \cite{TransE} and \transd \cite{TransD} are highlighted.
Other embedding models represent \distmult \cite{DistMult} and \complex \cite{ComplEx}, which are based on semantic matching. 

% NEGATIVE SAMPLING
Due to the importance of sampling good negative triples, much research in this area has been done in recent years.
However, standard techniques continue to be Uniform Random Sampling \cite{TransE} and Bernoulli Sampling \cite{TransH}.
They do not produce high-quality negative triples but are used in many models due to their simplicity and high performance.  
A more complex approach for generating negative samples is, for example, domain sampling \cite{domainSampling}.
It samples only entities from a subset of entities of a \ac{KG}.
Pioneers of dynamic negative sampling are \kbgan \cite{cai2017kbgan} and \igan \cite{IGAN}.
They attempt to estimate the distribution of negative triples by constructing a \ac{GAN}.
Inspired by \acp{GAN}, which were proposed for generating samples in a continuous space such as images, they are adjusted to improve \ac{KGE} models through an adversarial learning process \cite{cai2017kbgan}.
An overview of all the different negative sampling techniques is given for example from Qian et. al \cite{qiannegative} and Yang et. al \cite{MCNS}.

% ACTIVE LEARNING + UNCERTAINTY SAMPLING
Besides this, our approach includes research on uncertainty sampling in active learning which supports supervised learning systems where unlabeled data is abundant, but it is difficult, time-consuming, or expensive to obtain labeled instances \cite{Settles2009ActiveLL}.
In active learning, there are several different approaches available to select the instances to be labeled.
One of them is uncertainty sampling which uses a classifier to identify unlabeled examples with the least confidence \cite{5272205}.
Therefore, the most informative unlabeled examples are selected for human annotation.
In turn, in uncertainty sampling, several measures are available on how to obtain the uncertain cases of a classifier \cite{nguyen2021howtomeasure}.
