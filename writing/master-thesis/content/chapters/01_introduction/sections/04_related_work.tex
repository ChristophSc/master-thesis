% EMBEDDING MODELS
The history of \acp{KG} goes back several years, but in recent years there has been a lot of research in this area, especially in the context of \acp{KGE}.  
Dai et. al \cite{electronics9050750} created an overview of several different and most common used embedding models, their approaches and application possibilities.
Among many different embedding models, the distance-based models \transe \cite{TransE} and \transd \cite{TransD} can be highlighted, which will also take a more important part in the course of this work.
Other embedding models represent \distmult \cite{DistMult} and \complex \cite{ComplEx}, which are based on semantic matching. 

% NEGATIVE SAMPLING
Due to the importance of sampling good negative triples, much research has also been done in this area in recent years.
However, standard techniques continue to be Uniform Random Sampling \cite{TransE} and Bernoulli Sampling \cite{TransH}, which do not produce high quality negative triples, but are used in many models due to their simplicity and high performance.  
A more complex approach to generate negative samples is, for example, domain sampling \cite{domainSampling}, which samples only entities from a subset of the entities of a \ac{KG}.
Pioneers of dynamic negative sampling are \kbgan \cite{cai2017kbgan} and \igan \cite{IGAN}, which attempt to estimate the distribution of negative triples by constructing a \ac{GAN}.
Inspired by \acp{GAN}, which were proposed for generating samples in a continuous space such as images, pre-trained models are improved through an adversarial learning process.
An overview over all the different negative sampling techniques is given for example in \cite{qiannegative} or \cite{MCNS}.

% ACTIVE LEARNING + UNCERTAINTY SAMPLING
In addition to this topic of \acp{KGE}, our approach includes other work in the literature regarding uncertainty sampling of active learning.
Originally, uncertainty sampling comes from active learning which supports supervised learning systems where unlabeled data is abundant, but it is difficult, time-consuming, or expensive to obtain labeled instances \cite{Settles2009ActiveLL}.
Several different approaches are available to select the instances to be labeled.
Uncertainty sampling is one of them and uses a classifier to identify unlabeled examples with the least confidence \cite{5272205}.
Therefore, the most informative unlabeled examples are selected for human annotation.
In turn, in the uncertainty sampling, several measures are available on how to obtain the uncertain cases of the classifier \cite{nguyen2021howtomeasure}.
