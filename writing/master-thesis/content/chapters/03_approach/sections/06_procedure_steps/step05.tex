\textbf{5. Passing Positive Triple and Sampled Negative Triple to Discriminator}\\
% DESCRIPTION
Subsequently, the sampled negative triple, as well as the original positive triples, are passed to the discriminator D.
According to our example, the original positive triple $l = (h,r,t) = (NewOrleans, LocatedIn, Louisiana)$ and a negative triple is given to the discriminator D.
As described in the step before, most probably $l_4'$ was sampled because it obtained the highest uncertainty score.
Therefore, negative triple $l_4' = (NewOrleans, LocatedIn, China)$ is passed to the discriminator D.
In the original approach, it is most likely that $t_3 = Florida$ would have been sampled, as this achieved the highest score in the generator.
But our approach tries to improve the embeddings in the discriminator where the generator is uncertain how to classify it either as a positive or a negative triple.
