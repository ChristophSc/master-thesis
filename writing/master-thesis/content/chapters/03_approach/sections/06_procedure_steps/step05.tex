\textbf{5. Passing Positive Triple and Sampled Negative Triple to Discriminator}\\
Subsequently, the sampled negative triple as well as the original positive triples is passed to the discriminator D.

According to our example, originals positive triple $l_p = (h,r,t) = (NewOrleans, LocatedIn, Louisiana)$ and a negative triple is sampled.
As described in step before, this is most probable $l_4$ where tail entity was replaced by entity $t_4 = China$.
Therefore, $l_4 = (NewOrleans, LocatedIn, China)$ is passed to discriminator.
In the original approach, it is most likely that $t_3 = Florida$ would have been sampled, as this achieved the highest score in the generator.
But our approach tries to improve the embeddings in the discriminator where the generator is unsure how to classify it either as positive or negative triple.
Since classification is based on scoring values, their embedding needs to be adjusted such that scoring function $f_G$ retrieves a lower score for sampled negative triples and therefore, it is easier to classify.
