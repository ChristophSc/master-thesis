\textbf{2. Calculating Minimum and Maximum Score for Positive and Negative Triples}\\
% DESCRIPTION
To be able to carry out the classification in the later uncertainty sampling process, the minimum and maximum scoring values are needed for classification later on (\Autoref{sec:calculation_of_probabilities_for_triple_classification}).
To obtain $score_{min}$ and $score_{max}$ is the goal of this step.
To achieve this, the scores of all positive triples of the \ac{KG} as well as the negative triples of $Neg$ are calculated before the actual adversarial training process.
For this purpose, they are passed to the generator model G.
Subsequently, a score for all triples is calculated with the scoring function $f_G$.
Assuming the \ac{KG} consists of $N$ positive triples and for each triple, a negative triple set of size $N_s$ was first created. 
Consequently, scores of $N$ positive triples and $N \cdot N_s$ negative triples are calculated to obtain the minimum and maximum scores of positive and negative triples.

% EXAMPLE
In our example, a score was calculated for the positive triple $l = (h,r,t)$ and the corresponding five negative triples $l_i' = (h,r,t_i')$  with $i \in [1,5]$ as well as for all other positive triples of the \ac{KG} and their corresponding negative triples.
The calculated scores of our example negative triple set are depicted in \Autoref{tab:generator_scores_of_neg}.

    \caption{Example: For each negative triple
    $\{(h,r,t_i')\}$ with $i \in [1,5]$ a score was calculated by the generator scoring function $f_G$.
    This was done not only for this negative triple set but also for the positive triple $l = (h,r,t)$ and all other positive triples of the KG and their corresponding negative triples.}

Taking the scores of all positive triples of the \ac{KG} and their negative triple sets results in scoring ranges for negative and positive triples.
These are shown in \autoref{fig:scoring_ranges}.

  The uncertainty of a model is in the scoring range where the model found scores of both positive and negative triples.}
  \label{fig:scoring_ranges}
\end{figure}
For negative triples, we obtained a score range of $[-9.1, 2.2]$, for positive triples a score range of $[-4, 10.7]$ and overlap between $[-4, 2.2]$.
Therefore, $score_{min} = -9.1$ and $score_{max} = 10.7$.
Since we have a fixed negative triple set for each epoch, they only need to be calculated once before each epoch.
