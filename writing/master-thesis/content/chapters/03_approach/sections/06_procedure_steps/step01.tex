\textbf{1. Creation of Negative Triple Set Neg}\\
% DESCRIPTION OF STEP
For each epoch in the training process, a set of negative triples is created.
This set is defined by $Neg(h,r,t)=\{(h_i',r,t_i')\}_{i=1\dots N_s}$ and created by Bernoulli sampling of $N_s$ entities that replace either the head or the tail entity in a positive triple.
For each epoch and for each positive triple $(h,r,t) \in \kg$ a negative triple set is created.

% EXAMPLE
For simplicity, it is assumed that for each positive triple a negative triple set of size five is created and only the tail entity is replaced.
As an example, \Autoref{tab:neg_example} shows the negative triples $l_i' = (h, r, t_i))$ with $i \in [1,5]$ that were generated by replacing tail entity $t = Louisiana$ in the positive triple $(h, r, t) = (NewOrleans, LocatedIn, Louisiana)$.

    \caption{Example: For a given positive triple $(h,r,t)$ five different negative triples were created by replacing the tail entity $t$ to obtain negative triple set $Neg = \{(h,r,t_i)\}$ with $i \in [1,5]$.}

This creation of a negative triple set is done for each positive triple of the KG.
