\textbf{1. Creation of Negative Triple Set Neg}\\
For each epoch in the training process a set of negative triples is created.
This set, which is defined by $Neg(h,r,t)=\{(h_i',r,t_i')\}_{i=1\dots N_s}$, is created by Bernoulli sampling of $N_s$ negative triples.
Therefore, either head or tail entity is replaced with different probabilities according to the mapping property of relations and entities.
In comparison to Random Sampling, it applies higher probabilities to head entity replacement in one-to-many relations and tail in many-to-one relations \cite{qiannegative}.
For each epoch and for each positive triple $(h,r,t) \in KG$ a negative triple set is created.
In \kbgan as well as our approach the size of $Neg$ is set to twenty.

In our example for illustration purposes, we only consider a negative triple set $Neg$ of size five.
\Autoref{tab:neg_example} shows five different negative triples $l_i$ with $i \in [1,5]$.
For simplicity for a positive triples $(h,r,t) = (\text{})$
only tail entities are replaced to obtain $l_i$.
