\textbf{3. Calculate Score for all Negative Triples in $Neg$}\\

At this point, the adversarial training between generator and discriminator starts.
In this training, the negative triples from the set Neg are passed on to the generator model G.
Since the generator is a tensor factorisation-based model, the score and thus the plausibility of each triple $l$ is calculated with the scoring function $f_G$.
Therefore, With this step a score $s_i$ for each triple $l_i = (h',r,t') \in Neg$ is calculated.
In the original \kbgan approach the sampling probabilities are directly calculated from scores and given to the Sampler.

According to 
.
Since our approach needs the scores to classify the triples, instead the output of the generator are scores for each negative triple in $Neg$.


Softmax Function which is defined as 
\begin{equation}
    s(x_i) = \frac{x_i}{\sum_{j=1}^{n}{e^{x_j}}}
\end{equation}
and therefore, for the original sampling probability $p_i$ to sample negative triple $l_i$ we obtain 
\begin{equation}
    p_i = s(f_G(l_i)) = \frac{f_G(l_i)}{\sum_{j=1}^{N_s}{e^{f_G(l_j)}}}
\end{equation}
