% what uncertainty?
% Option1: EBU: conflicting vs insufficient evidence (within one model)
% Option2: EAU epistemic <-> aleatoric uncertainty (among multiple models)
% CU: reducible and irreducible part of uncertainty in a prediction
In the literature we have several types of uncertainty at our disposal, based on which Negative Sampling can be performed.
As described in \autoref{sec:uncertaintysampling}, there are three different approaches of \ac{EBU}, \ac{EAU} and \ac{CU}.
These methods for calculating uncertainty are based on different viewpoints, but all of them are based on a classification problem of two or more classes.
In \ac{EBU} we consider the uncertainty within a model by looking at the individual features of a model and if they provide evidence for the classes.
This can be either very many (\textit{conflicting-evidence}) or only a few features (\textit{insufficient-evidence}) which are indicative for the respective classes.
In contrast, \ac{EAU} considers \textit{epistemic uncertainty} within a single modelâ€™s prediction, and \textit{aleatoric uncertainty} across multiple model predictions \cite{human-in-the-loop}.
Since \textit{credal uncertainty} differentiates between the reducible and irreducible part of the uncertainty in a prediction and the domination of one class over the other, we calculate uncertainty among multiple models as well.
% for this model again have conflicting evidence or insufficient evidence for one class
% -> Firstly we focus on uncertainty within one model (generator kge model) -> can be insufficient or conflicting evidence
The \kbgan approach does not provide any additional features for the sampling process, only the scores of all negative triples from $Neg$ and their corresponding sampling probabilities.
For this reason, we will first take the point of view of epistemic uncertainty from \ac{EAU}.
If we add further models for a classification between negative and positive triples in the later process or add additional features, the other viewpoints aleatoric uncertainty, \ac{EAU} and \ac{CU} can be taken as well.
