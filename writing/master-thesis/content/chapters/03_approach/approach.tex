In this chapter, our approach Sampling of Negative Triples for Knowledge Graph Embeddings by Uncertainty is described.
At first, in \Autoref{sec:motivation} the general motivation of sampling by uncertainty is described and how this idea came about.
First of all, we have various uncertainty frameworks at our disposal for sampling.
These are discussed in \Autoref{sec:selection_of_an_uncertainty_sampling_type}.
Subsequently, to measure uncertainty and sample negative triples, a classification problem needs to be defined which takes place in \Autoref{sec:definition_of_a_classification_problem}.
In \Autoref{sec:calculation_of_probabilities_for_triple_classification}, different possibilities to calculate probabilities of whether a triple belongs to a class are described.
From these probabilities, uncertainty scores can be derived to finally sample negative triples by uncertainty (\Autoref{sec:calculation_of_uncertainty_scores}).
The individual steps are then reflected in the modified procedure of \textsc{KBGAN} for our approach (\Autoref{sec:procedure}).
