\chapter{Approach}
\label{ch:approach}

In this chapter our approach of Sampling of Negative Triples for Knowledge Graph Embeddings by Uncertainty is described.
At first, in \Autoref{sec:idea} the general idea of Sampling by Uncertainty is described and how this idea came about.
First of all, as described in \Autoref{sec:uncertaintysampling}, we have various metrics available for Uncertainty Sampling.
These are discussed in \Autoref{sec:selection_of_an_uncertainty_sampling_metric} and a suitable metric for our problem is determined.
Subsequently, to measure uncertainty and sample negative triples a classification problem needs to be defined which takes place in \Autoref{sec:definition_of_a_classification_problem}.
In \Autoref{sec:calculation_of_probabilitie_for_triple_classification}, different possibilities to calculate the individual probabilities of whether a given triple is positive or negative can be calculated.
From these probabilities uncertainty scores can be derived to finally sample negative triples by uncertainty (\Autoref{sec:calculation_of_uncertainty_scores}).
The individual steps are then reflected in the modified procedure of our approach (\Autoref{sec:procedure}).
At the end of the chapter, various possibilities for improving the classification are listed (\Autoref{sec:improving_classification}).
