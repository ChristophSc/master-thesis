  \caption{Uncertainty Sampling component which contains the Classifier,  Uncertainty Scorer, and  Sampler component. 
  The Sampler can sample either according to \usmax or \ussoftmax sampling method. 
  The input of the Uncertainty Sampling component are scores of triples and the output is one negative triple sampled by uncertainty.
  In this example, most probable the triple $t_4$ is sampled because it is closest to 50\% with a probability of 42.03\%.
  Thus, based on the classification, it can be a positive or negative triple.
  Therefore, it has the highest uncertainty score of 0.9575.}
