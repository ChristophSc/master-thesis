\section{Future work} 
\label{sec:futurework}



FUTURE WORK:
- combine Uncertainty Sampling with other approaches
- increase performance of uncertainty sampling
- filter negatives by removing al negative triples from set $Neg$ which appear in the KG
- optimize approach by using state of the art PyTorch methods, since KBGAN is based on very old version
- this might increase performance
- extend approach with cache like in approach NSCaching 
-> especially in smaller datasets like UMLS  there are a several duplicates and each epoch the same negative triples are sampled
-> create statistics on Negative set how many times each triple was sampled (uncertainty <-> random) for UMLS dataset
create figure (bar chart) and save plot
