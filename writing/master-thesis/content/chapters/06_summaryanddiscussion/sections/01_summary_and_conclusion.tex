summary



conclusion
further reasearch of generator performance 
-> show also validation MRR and Hit@10 of Generator during training
-> results:
both MRR and Hit@10 increases, but very slow + slower than discriminator model
best performance is worse than original model (pre-trained, without adversarial training, only the model)
reason:
-> goal of generator is not to find good embeddings but to provide good negative samples for discriminator
-> this may effect the ranges of positive and negative triple scores
-> might be more accurate with traditional generator goal to find a good embedding
->
