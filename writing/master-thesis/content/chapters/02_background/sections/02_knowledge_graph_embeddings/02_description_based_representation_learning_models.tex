\subsection{Description-Based Representation Learning Models}
\label{subsec:description_based_representation_learning_models}

Description-Based Representation Learning Models can also be broken down into three further categories:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item 
    \textbf{Textual Description-Based Models} is an extension of the traditional triplet-based model and integrates additional textual information for entities to evolve its performance.
    Examples are \ac{TKRL} \cite{TKRL} and \ac{TEKE} \cite{TEKE}.
    
    \item 
    \textbf{Relation Path-Based Models} refines the performance of an embedding model by multi-step relational paths, which reveal semantic relations between the entities.
    One example is \ac{PTransE} \cite{PTransE}.
    
     \item 
    \textbf{Other Models} that cannot be assigned to the other two categories and pay attention to further triple information such as temporal aspects.
\end{enumerate}
