\subsection{Description-Based Representation Learning Models}
\label{subsec:description_based_representation_learning_models}

The category of description-based representation learning models can also be broken down into three further groups \cite{electronics9050750}.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item 
    \textbf{Textual Description-Based Models} are an extension of the traditional triplet-based model and integrate additional textual information for entities to evolve their performance.
    Examples are \ac{TKRL} \cite{TKRL} and \ac{TEKE} \cite{TEKE}.
    
    \item 
    \textbf{Relation Path-Based Models} refine the performance of an embedding model by multi-step relational paths, which reveal semantic relations between the entities.
    One example is \ac{PTransE} \cite{PTransE}.
    
    \item 
    \textbf{Other Models} that cannot be assigned to the other two categories and pay attention to further triple information such as temporal aspects.
\end{enumerate}
