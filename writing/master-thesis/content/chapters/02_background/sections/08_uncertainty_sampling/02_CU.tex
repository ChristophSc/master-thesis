\subsection{Credal Uncertainty}  
\label{subsec:credal_uncertainty}

\ac{CU} seeks to differentiate between the reducible and irreducible part of the uncertainty in a prediction by defining a credal set of models with probability distributions \cite{nguyen2021howtomeasure}.
A class $y$ is dominated by another class $y'$ if $y$ is more likely than $y'$ for any distribution in the credal set $C$ \cite{nguyen2021howtomeasure}
\begin{equation} \label{eq:credal_uncertainty_dominance}
\gamma(y,y',x) = \inf_{\theta \in C} \frac{p_{\theta}(y | x)}{p_{\theta}(y' | x)} > 1
\end{equation} 
An instance x is sampled, which has the least evidence for the dominance of one of the classes \cite{nguyen2021howtomeasure}.
Therefore, in case of binary classification with $\mathcal{Y} = \{0, 1\}$ this dominance is calculated by the score which is defined as
\begin{equation}
    s(x) = -max (\gamma(1,0,x), \gamma(0,1,x))
\end{equation} 
For binary classification where $p_{\theta}(0|x) = 1 - p_{\theta}(1|x)$ inserted in \Autoref{eq:credal_uncertainty_dominance}, results in  
\begin{equation}
\gamma(1,0,x) = \inf_{\theta \in C} \frac{p_{\theta}(1 | x)}{1 - p_{\theta}(1 | x)}
\end{equation} 
and
\begin{equation}
\gamma(0,1,x) = \inf_{\theta \in C} \frac{1 - p_{\theta}(1 | x)}{p_{\theta}(1 | x)}
\end{equation}
