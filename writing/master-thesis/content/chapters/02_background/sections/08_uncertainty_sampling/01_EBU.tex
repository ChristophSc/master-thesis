\subsection{Evidence-based Uncertainty} 
\label{subsec:evidence_based_uncertainty}
%
\Ac{EBU} differentiates between uncertainty due to conflicting evidence and insufficient evidence \cite{nguyen2021howtomeasure}.
\ac{EBU} checks the influence of individual features $x^m$ in a feature representation 
$x = (x^1,..., x^d)$ of instances \cite{nguyen2021howtomeasure}.
For a given model $\theta$, the class-conditional probabilities, denoted as $p_{\theta}(x^m |0)$ and $p_{\theta}(x^m | 1)$ for binary classes 0 and 1, the values of the m-th feature for a given instance x are considered.
Subsequently, the set of features is partitioned into those that provide evidence for a positive class
\begin{equation}
    P_{\theta}(x) = \bigg\{ x^m \bigg| \frac{p_{\theta}(x^m|1)}{p_{\theta}(x^m|0)} > 1 \bigg\} 
\end{equation}
and those that provide evidence for a negative class \cite{nguyen2021howtomeasure}:
 \begin{equation}
    N_{\theta}(x) = \bigg\{ x^m \bigg| \frac{p_{\theta}(x^m|0)}{p_{\theta}(x^m|1)} > 1 \bigg\} 
\end{equation}
Afterward, either the instance with the highest conflicting evidence (\ac{CEU}) or where both evidences are low (\ac{IEU}) are queried (insufficient evidence).
The total evidence for positive class $E_1$ 
\begin{equation}
    E_1(x) = \prod\limits_{x^m \in P_{\theta}(x)} \frac{p_{\theta}(x^m|1)}{p_{\theta}(x^m|0)}
\end{equation}
and negative class $E_0$
\begin{equation}
    E_0(x) = \prod\limits_{x^m \in N_{\theta}(x)} \frac{p_{\theta}(x^m|0)}{p_{\theta}(x^m|1)}.
\end{equation} 
is determined \cite{nguyen2021howtomeasure}.
Therefore, conflicting evidence is present if $E_1$ and $E_0$ are high.
Likewise, if both $E_1$ and $E_0$ are low uncertainty because of insufficient evidence is measured.
