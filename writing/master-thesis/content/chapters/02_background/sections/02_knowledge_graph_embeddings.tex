\section{Knowledge Graph Embeddings} 
\label{sec:knowledge_graph_embeddings}


\acfp{KGE} are low-dimensional representations of entities and relations in a \ac{KG}. 
Numerous methods have been developed in the last few years to tackle various problems such as defining a different score function to measure the distance between entities relative to their relation.
Depending on the dimensionality of the embedding space and which types of relations should be embedded, a different embedding can be chosen.
While some of them support only symmetric relations, others support antisymmetric ones as well. 
Besides this, the types of relations in a \ac{KG} differ from each other.
We can differentiate between 1-to-1, 1-to-N, N-to-1, and N-to-N relations.
Overall, all the embedding methods can be separated by three different aspects \cite{electronics9050750}:
(i) How entities and relations are represented, (ii) how the scoring function is defined and (iii) how the ranking criterion is optimized.
On the basis of this, the two different categories 
\textit{Triplet Fact-Based Representation Learning Models} (\Autoref{subsec:triplet_fact_based_representation_learning_models}) and \textit{Description-Based Representation Learning Models} (\Autoref{subsec:description_based_representation_learning_models}) can be derived \cite{electronics9050750}.
