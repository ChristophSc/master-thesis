\section{Knowledge Graph Embeddings} 
\label{sec:knowledge_graph_embeddings}


\acp{KGE} are low-dimensional representations of entities and relations in a \ac{KG}. 
Numerous methods have been developed in the last few years to tackle various problems such as defining a different score function to measure the distance between entities relative to their relation.
Depending on the dimensionality of the embedding space and which types of relations should be embedded, a different embedding can be chosen.
While some of them support only symmetric relations, others support antisymmetric ones as well. 
Besides this, the types of relations in a \ac{KG} differ from each other.
We can differentiate between 1-to-1, 1-to-N, N-to-1, and N-to-N relations.
Overall, all the embedding methods can be separated by three different aspects \cite{electronics9050750}:
(i) How they represent entities and relations, (ii) how they define the scoring function and (iii) how they optimize the ranking criterion.
On the basis of this, two different categories are derived:
\textit{Triplet Fact-Based Representation Learning Models} \Autoref{subsec:triplet_fact_based_representation_learning_models} and \textit{Description-Based Representation Learning Models} \Autoref{subsec:description_based_representation_learning_models} \cite{electronics9050750}.
