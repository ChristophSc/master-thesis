\section{Training Techniques and Loss Functions}
\label{sec:training_techniques_and_loss_functions}
%
For embedding learning \ac{KGE} models use different loss functions and training techniques.
Some of these are presented in \Autoref{subsec:loss_functions} and \Autoref{subsec:training_techniques}.
Since negative sampling is the basis of the new uncertainty-based negative sampling, this training technique is described in more detail in \Autoref{subsec:negative_sampling_methods}.
