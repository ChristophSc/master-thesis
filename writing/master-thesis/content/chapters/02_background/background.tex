\chapter{Background}
\label{ch:background}

To ensure a uniform understanding of the methods and technologies used in this thesis, important definitions of terms are given in this chapter.
Furthermore, various contents are presented, which underlie our approach and are important for its understanding.

Since our approach deals with \acp{KG}, a more precise definition of term is given in \Autoref{sec:knowledge_graphs}.
Another important part are \acp{KGE}, which map information in form of entities and relations of a \ac{KG} in a low-dimensional vector space.
Therefore, several types of \acp{KGE} and the most important ones for this work are presented in \Autoref{sec:knowledge_graph_embeddings}.
All of them have different training objectives which can mathematically represented by different loss-function which have to be optimized during the training time.
Their definitions are given in \Autoref{sec:training_objective_types}.
Besides negative sampling, there are other techniques for training \ac{KGE} models.
For their differentiation definitions of all techniques are given in \Autoref{sec:training_techniques}. 
Subsequently, different types of negative sampling from the literature are described in \Autoref{sec:negativesamplingmethods}.
Since our approach of incorporating uncertainty sampling is based on an already existing approach, it is presented in more detail in \Autoref{sec:kbgan}.
In \Autoref{sec:evaluating_knowledge_graph_embeddings}, different methods are presented how to measure the accuracy of learned embeddings.
Finally, uncertainty sampling from active learning and its different approaches and measures are presented at the end of this chapter in \Autoref{sec:uncertaintysampling}.
