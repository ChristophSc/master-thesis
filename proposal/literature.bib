abstract = {Skip-gram with negative sampling, a popular variant of Word2vec originally designed
and tuned to create word embeddings for Natural Language Processing, has been used
to create item embeddings with successful applications in recommendation. While these
fields do not share the same type of data, neither evaluate on the same tasks, recommendation
applications tend to use the same already tuned hyperparameters values, even if optimal
hyperparameters values are often known to be data and task dependent. We thus investigate
the marginal importance of each hyperparameter in a recommendation setting through
large hyperparameter grid searches on various datasets. Results reveal that optimizing
neglected hyperparameters, namely negative sampling distribution, number of epochs,
subsampling parameter and window-size, significantly improves performance on a recommendation
task, and can increase it by an order of magnitude. Importantly, we find that optimal
hyper-parameters configurations for Natural Language Processing tasks and Recommendation
tasks are noticeably different.},
