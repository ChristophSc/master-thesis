\chapter{Introduction}
\label{ch:introduction}

%This is the documentation of the \ac{template}.
%In this chapter, you find everything you need to know to get started with your
%thesis --- or at least the \LaTeX{} side of it. 
%The other chapters of this document provide you with further details of the
%template.
%Besides a full documentation of the document class file that \ac{template}
%uses and the auxiliary files \ac{template} supplies, we also provide you with
%a short guide on certain aspects of \LaTeX{}, and particularly the \LaTeX{}
%packages that \ac{template} loads by default.
%However, it is assumed that you know some \LaTeX{} already.
%If you are unfamiliar with \LaTeX{} you should consult a proper introduction
%first, for example the \LaTeX{} guide by Oetiker \etal{} \cite{LatexGuide}.


%\paragraph{Organization}
%In the remainder of this chapter, we discuss how to
%\hyperref[sec:introduction:start]{get started} with the \ac{template} template,
%and what \hyperref[sec:introduction:folders]{directory structure} the template
%provides and assumes.

%In Chapter~\ref{ch:class_file}, we provide a documentation of the
%\emph{upb\_cs\_thesis} document class provided by the \ac{template} template.
%The template loads a number of \LaTeX{} packages by default.
%Chapter~\ref{ch:packages} provides an overview.

%Chapter~\ref{ch:guide} provides a guide to both beginners and experts on
%aspects of packages that \ac{template} loads by default for you to use.
%Particularly, the chapter discusses some style aspects of good writing,
%references, including bibliographic references, graphics, and tables.
%Finally, in Chapter~\ref{ch:makefiles}, we provide a documentation of and
%troubleshooting guide for the \emph{Makefiles} that come with this template.


% Data Science
% old: relational databases
% new: Knowledge Graph
- 
- applications 
    - question answering, dialogue agents, recommendation systems
- required knowledge is usually stored in KG
- Knowledge Graph
- different databases
- to optimize the applications
- different research areas for \acp{KB} emerged, 
such as  construction, querying and maintenance.
- area maintenance
- contain only positive statements
- inability to deal with negative information
- to create these, a problem arises: 
- only be inferred with the major assumption that the KB is complete
- like in reality, this would result in a \ac{CWA}
-> we assume that missing statements represent their falseness.
- not realistic to assume for KG
- we do not know, if the information is false or just unknown
- in KG \ac{OWA} represented statements in KG are true
-> statements that are not represented in \ac{KG} are just considered as unknown.
- not possible to formally distinguish if a statement is false or unknown
