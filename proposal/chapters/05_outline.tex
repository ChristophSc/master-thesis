\chapter{Outline}
\label{ch:outline}

In total, the thesis is planned to be divided into the following seven chapters:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Introduction
    \item Related work
    \item Background
    \item Approach
    \item Implementation
    \item Evaluation
    \item Summary and Discussion
\end{enumerate}
First follows a general introduction to the topic, which contains the motivation of the \ac{UCGAN} approach and the thesis.
In the next chapter related work is presented, which investigates state-of-the-art approaches which underlie the \ac{UCGAN} approach.
After providing background with a comprehensive problem analysis in chapter three, our approach is described in detail in the following chapter.
Afterwards, we will explain the implementation in more detail and an evaluation will take place by comparing our approach with others.
Finally, a summary of the \ac{UCGAN} approach is given.
The chapter structure of the work shown here can be further subdivided into subchapters and subsections, which are not given due to simplicity.
